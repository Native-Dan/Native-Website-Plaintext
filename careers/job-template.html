<h2>[Job Title] at Native</h2><b>Job Description</b>
----------------
In an era where insurance innovation has often promised more than it's delivered, the industry finds itself in a state of inertia. Native has been created to engineer a new paradigm for Digital Assets insurance for the community, by the community.

As the first dedicated global broker in this space, we're building the bridge between the traditional insurance industry and on-chain finance. Our approach combines deep blockchain expertise with extensive insurance experience, using crypto-native technologies as our company’s foundation. We're not just adapting old models; we're creating a system that outlasts and outperforms into the future.

At Native, it’s different. We question established norms, not out of rebellion, but because we believe insurance can do more and be better. We're building a team of world-class individuals who bring fresh thinking to age-old problems. If you've ever felt out of step with traditional insurance practices, or if you've had ideas brushed aside because "that's not how we do things", we'd like to talk to you. Our duty is to reshape the status quo, not maintain it.
